Computational Approaches to Problem Solving

Course Description:
The course is an introduction to the key concepts in computational thinking such as algorithmic thinking, abstraction and decomposition. The students will also gain basic programming skills in order to apply computational thinking concepts in practice.

Through the lectures, take-home exams, and interactive recitations specific to different disciplines, the students will learn how to design algorithms, how to divide a problem into subproblems, and how to build a solution by means of compositions. Evaluation of the solutions in terms of correctness and efficiency will also be covered.

In order to enable students apply computational thinking skills in practice, basic programming concepts, such as variables, statements, conditionals, iteration, and functions will be introduced by using a simple programming language such as Python.

### CURRICULUM ###

Introduction & Motivation We will introduce the course to students and talk about our motivations. The reason behind this course being a university course (not for only CS students, but everyone) will be discussed and the importance of this course will be emphasized. Also, general idea of computational thinking will be covered and some examples from different disciplines are provided.

From Puzzles to Real World Problems Computational thinking includes 4 important concepts: (i) decomposition, (ii) pattern recognition, (iii) abstraction, and           (iv) algorithm design. We will explain these concepts in detail. It is very important to understand the features of each aspect and their roles in solving a problem computationally. Several examples will be provided for these aspects, from different disciplines and daily life. 

Developing Algorithms We will talk about designing algorithms in real problems. Writing pseudocodes and designing flowcharts will be covered. This way, components of Computational Thinking will be practiced with the examples without any coding. Additionally, Python will be mentioned for the first time to be used in the following weeks. We will be using Python to realize each one of the aspects of computational thinking separately in different topics.

Let the Coding Begin We will introduce the first Python program to the students. Syntax, variables, operators, standard input/outputs, basic problems with simple calculations, strings and lists will be covered. Besides, we will discuss using different libraries, especially for graph drawing purposes.

To Be or Not To Be: Making Decisions Some problems can be solved with basic operators and calculations, however some problems need decision making. Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied, which is examined through Boolean expressions. Students will learn to determine which action to take and which statements to execute depending on the outcome. Decision making is a crucial point of "Algorithm Design", thus various examples from different disciplines will be covered.

String Like a Bee Strings and lists are amongst the most popular types in Python. We will discuss about using some of Python's built-in methods in order to be able to manipulate sequences. It will be good practice for the "Abstraction" aspect of computational thinking.

The Copying Game In general, statements are executed sequentially. However, some statements may be executed depending on a decision, and there may also be a situation when a block of code needs to be executed several times. A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Loops are also a crucial point of "Algorithm Design", thus various examples from different disciplines will be covered.

Civilization with Modularity A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for our applications and a high degree of code reuse. In this week, students will learn to implement their own "user-defined" functions. Functions will be a good practice for decomposition and abstraction aspects of computational thinking. Additionally, we will discuss the scope of the defined and referred variables.

Letâ€™s Get Organized The most basic data structure in Python is the sequence. Each element of a sequence is assigned a number - its position or index. There are certain things you can do with all sequence types. These operations include indexing, slicing, adding, multiplying, and checking for membership. Some built-in functions of lists as finding the length of a sequence or finding its largest /smallest elements will also be covered. Additionally, tuples and its differences will be mentioned. Besides, Python dictionary is a container of the unordered set of objects. It is aimed to show the role of dictionaries in specific problems. Data structures have an important role for the abstraction of problems, thus should be emphasized under Computational Thinking approaches.

Verba Volant Scripta Manent (The faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory) Sometimes we need to read/write from/to files. Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default. Students will learn these details.

Winter is Coming Some futuristic and eye-opening topics will be covered.
